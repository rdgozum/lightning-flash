Flash is a task-based deep learning framework for flexible deep learning built on PyTorch Lightning.
Tasks can be anything from text classification to object segmentation.
Although PyTorch Lightning provides ultimate flexibility, for common tasks it does not remove 100% of the boilerplate.
Flash is built for applied researchers, beginners, data scientists, Kagglers or anyone starting out with Deep Learning.
But unlike other entry-level frameworks (keras, etc...), Flash users can switch to Lightning trivially when they need
the added flexibility.
